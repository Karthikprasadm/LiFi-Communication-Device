INTRODUCTION
LiFi, or Light Fidelity, is a wireless communication technology that uses light to transmit data. Unlike traditional WiFi, which relies on radio waves, LiFi employs visible light, ultraviolet, and infrared light to transfer information. This is achieved through modulation of light intensity, allowing for high-speed data transmission. LiFi offers several advantages, including faster speeds, reduced interference, and enhanced security, as light cannot penetrate walls, making it difficult for unauthorized users to access the network. 


Early Concepts (1880s): Alexander Graham Bell invented the photophone, transmitting sound using light.
Term Coined (2011): Professor Harald Haas introduced "LiFi" during a TED talk, showcasing LED-based data transmission.
Initial Research (2012): Research into LiFi gained momentum, exploring its applications and capabilities.
